This is a recipe project that will utilize tags and attributes pertaining to lists, images, hyperlinks, text formatting, and some other tags, as well as some basic git commands and Linux terminal usage.

This project is to fine tune basic html and git skills I have learned the past week. With this project I'll demonstrate my current proficiency in html, git, and the Linux terminal. 

More text was added to practice git functions.
